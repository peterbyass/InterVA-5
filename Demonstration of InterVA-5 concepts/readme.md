# Demonstration of InterVA-5 concepts

InterVA-5 is designed to process [verbal autopsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_autopsy) interview data (structured interviews according to [WHO standards](https://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/verbalautopsystandards/en/) with witnesses to circumstances of individual deaths). The intention of processing data from an individual verbal autopsy is to derive likely cause(s) of death for each case, which can then be analysed over large numbers of deaths at the population level.
