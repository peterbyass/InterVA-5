# Demonstration of InterVA-5 concepts

InterVA-5 is designed to process [verbal autopsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_autopsy) interview data (structured interviews according to [WHO standards](https://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/verbalautopsystandards/en/) with witnesses to circumstances of individual deaths). The intention of processing data from an individual verbal autopsy is to derive likely cause(s) of death for each case, which can then be analysed over large numbers of deaths at the population level.

Operationally, verbal autopsy interview data might come from already archived material, or it may be collected in communities on an on-going basis. Utilising hand-held devices to guide the interview, register and process the responses, and transmit the outputs is an effective approach to field operations, for example using the MIVA system. 

Whatever the source, the interview data have to be pre-processed into the input format required by InterVA-5 (which basically corresponds to the WHO 2016 VA standard), then InterVA-5 has to be run to process the individual cases, and then the InterVA-5 output data have to be analysed to yield overall results.
