# Download of InterVA-5 software

Links here take you to downloads of the InterVA-5 software, which is open-source public domain material.

The original version, as in earlier versions of InterVA models, is written in compiled FoxPro which runs under any real or virtual Windows environment without any requirements beyond downloading into a convenient folder. Click [here](http://www.interva.net/products.htm) for the download page. Documentation is included in the download.

A different software team has implemented an R version of the same InterVA-5 software, to provide a wider choice of source material but more importantly to independently co-validate the code and outputs between the two versions. Click [here](https://github.com/verbal-autopsy-software/InterVA5) to download the R version.
