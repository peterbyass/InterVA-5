# Download of InterVA-5 software

Links here take you to downloads of the InterVA-5 software, which is open-source public domain material.

The original version of InterVA-5, as in earlier versions of InterVA models, is implemented in compiled FoxPro which runs under any real or virtual Windows environment without any requirements beyond downloading into a convenient folder. Click [here](http://www.interva.net/products.htm) for the download page. Documentation is included in the download, also available [here](https://github.com/peterbyass/InterVA-5/blob/master/Download%20of%20InterVA-5%20software/InterVA-5.1%20UG.pdf). Any queries on using InterVA-5 can be sent to interva.query@gmail.com

A different software team has implemented an R version of the same InterVA-5 software, to provide a wider choice of source material, and more importantly to independently co-validate the code and outputs between the two versions. Click [here](https://github.com/verbal-autopsy-software/InterVA5) to go to the download page for the R version.
