# InterVA-5 evaluation using Afghanistan data

This evaluation is based on the DHS Afghanistan national mortality survey 2010. The Afghan 2010 mortality survey dataset is available on request from the DHS Program, https://dhsprogram.com/data/dataset/Afghanistan_Special_2010.cfm

The file interva5_Afghan_in.do reads the DHS Stata format file AMSdeaths_c1.dta and converts it into InterVA-5 input format. Other files in this folder downgrade the InterVA-5 format data into InterVA-4 and SmartVA formats for running under InterVA-5 to assess changes from using these more restricted data formats. Stata scripts for generating the graphics in the article are also included.
